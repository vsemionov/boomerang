0.5:
 * search notes in all notebooks
  * add a notes endpoint to users (/uses/<username>/notes/, read-only)
  * from there, call the notes view with resolve(reverse(view_name))
  * pass a notebook wildcard
  * in the notes view, do not call get_notebook() and do not filter by notebook if its id is the wildcard
  * to support hyperlinked representations, change the notebook links serializer to lookup the notebook id from the instance
 * custom sort mixin
 * resolve sort order collision with search mixin
 * what should be the default sort order (created ascending for consistent listints?)
 * explicit default sort order (currently note id order is reversed in notebook detail and note list)
 * consider indexing created and updated timestamps
 * Is trigram similarity greater when an equal-length document contains more occurrences of the search terms? Answer: YES!
 * consider re-adding all or some of the filter backends from commit 6a4ed822a61927fdba6adc25bb980040fe6d257e
 * Try to fetch related objects in a single query for lists of parents.
 * Max page size 50 if query count is proportional.
 * Check cause of duplicated queries in notebook detail.
 * tests

ui:
 * django messages framework, add messages to api template
 * allauth templates
