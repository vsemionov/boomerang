0.5:
 * configurable page size with limited max value
 * search notes in all notebooks
  * add a notes endpoint to users (/uses/<username>/notes/, read-only)
  * from there, call the notes view with resolve(reverse(view_name))
  * pass a notebook wildcard
  * in the notes view, do not call get_notebook() and do not filter by notebook if its id is the wildcard
  * to support hyperlinked representations, change the notebook links serializer to lookup the notebook id from the instance
 * consider indexing updated timestamps and ordering list results by them (in descending order)
 * consiger using filter backends for search, ordering and filtering (but find a way to apply them only to list views)
 * tests

ui:
 * django messages framework, add messages to api template
 * allauth templates
