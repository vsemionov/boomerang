0.5:
 * search:
  - combine rest framework filters (search and ordering, for filter forms) with viewset mixins (for result decoration)
   + use current query parameters (q and sort, respectively)
  - do not perform trigram similarity search in sorted views
  - add endpoints for full text search with trigram similarity
   + endpoints:
    ! /api/users/id/notebooks/search/
    ! /api/users/id/notebooks/id/notes/search/
    ! /api/users/id/notes/search/
    ! /api/users/id/tasks/search/
   + no sorting or sync on full text search endpoints
   + sort results by -rank, (internal) id
 * performance:
  - Try to fetch related objects in a single query for lists of parents.
  - Max page size 50 if query count is proportional.
  - Check cause of duplicated queries in notebook detail.
  - Why do listings of  unfiltered querysets with millions of items take long to execute? Doesn't the pagination add an offaet/limit clause?

ui:
 * django messages framework, add messages to api template
 * allauth templates
